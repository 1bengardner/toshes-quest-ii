### Story

The tale begins with the aftermath of an aquatic battle between good and evil, leaving Toshe lost at sea. Catastrophic shipwreck has left him stranded. And, in the depths of the Adriatic Sea, the anemonies aren't friendly.

Having a distinct preference for brawn over wit, Toshe won't go down without a fight. Sworn defender, Toshe dedicates his life to honour. It might sound like Toshe's trying to save the world, but he's really just trying to save his own butt. To do that, he needs some help. That's where you come in!

***

You take on the role of Toshe: Macedonia's unlikely, yet nonetheless heroic saviour-to-be.

Evil monsters have infested southern Europe and some dastardly villains have cropped up. As a warrior, you have volunteered yourself for cleanup duty. It is your oathbound obligation to protect your homeland from impending doom.

The gates of Macedonia can't hold forever, and as beasts attack the abandoned nation, its defences begin to crumble. As Macedonia's sole protector, you must act swiftly, for your actions determine its fate.

However, once the truth is revealed, it may be too late...
