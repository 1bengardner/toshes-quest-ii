Prepare yourself, warrior.	Come here!
Let the fight begin.	Let me show you what true power is!
I can take you on.	Take a good look--it'll all be over soon!
Brace yourself.	Do you know the definition of pain?

You're just another punk.	Taste this!
I'll go easy on this young guy.	This is the end of your crusade!
Fight me.	Don't you know who I am?

A duel for glory.	*lets out a battle cry.*
Winner takes all.	*swings his weapon above his head.*
My fame is on the line.	*holds his weapon to the sky.*
Show me what you're made of.	*ushers the crowd away from you and gestures for a battle.*
Let me test your mettle.	*points toward you.*
We shall see who is more skilful.	*slams his weapon to the ground, making a deafening sound.*
